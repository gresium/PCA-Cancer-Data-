# Cancer Data Analysis using PCA

# Description
Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a cancer dataset to reduce dimensionality, identify key features, and visualize the separation between benign and malignant samples using Python and scikit-learn.

# Objectives
Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Identify principal components capturing the most variance.
Visualize the dataset in 2D for clear class separation.
Interpret which features influence the diagnosis outcome.

# Dataset
Based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from scikit-learn.
Each record contains cell nucleus measurements with a binary diagnosis variable:
0 → Benign
1 → Malignant

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and encoded the dataset.
Feature Scaling – Standardized data using StandardScaler.
PCA Transformation – Computed top components and explained variance.
Visualization – Generated 2D PCA scatter plots and variance contribution charts.
Results
The top two components captured over 90% of total variance.
PCA visualization demonstrated clear separation between benign and malignant samples.
Identified which features contribute most to diagnostic variance.
